# Manual records

In addition to the data formats for which the scan automatically completes partial documentation and monitors updates, you can create a "manual" or "orphan" record at any time that is not associated with the source data.

You can choose from several templates:

* Dataset (vector);
* Dataset (raster)
;* Dataset series;
* Service;
* Resource.

Simply click on the `+Create` button in the Inventory. There are two ways to proceed:

* creating a blank record, specifying only a title;
* or by creating a record from an existing record imported in XML 19139 format.

This feature is useful in a number of cases:
if you do not have the scan function, or if you want to create metadata records in formats that are not supported (unsupported GIS formats, PDF maps, Excel statistics files, etc.).

> Tip: a workgroup administrator can disable this feature via the settings in the `Administration` menu.
