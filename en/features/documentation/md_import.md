# Importing standardized metadata

If your data supplier has provided you with metadata or if you already have metadata, you can use Isogeo to import it in XML ISO19139 or Dublin-Core format.

To do so, proceed as follows:
1.	Open a metadata record created either manually or by the scan;
2.	Click `Edit`;
3.	Click `Import`. The following pop-up window displays:

    ![Import XML](/assets/inv_edit_one_importXML.png "XML import form")

4.	Click on "Select file" Windows Explorer opens;
5.	Select the XML file to import;
6.	Enable or disable the `Overwrite existing values` option;
7.	Click on `Import`. The information from the XML file is imported to the metadata record.

The following fields are imported:

* title,
* summary
,* INSPIRE themes,
* keywords,
* the creation date for the metadata,
* metadata language,
* validity period,
* collection context,
* bounding box,
* equivalent scale,
* resolution,
* access and use conditions,
* resource type,
* format,
* metadata character encoding
