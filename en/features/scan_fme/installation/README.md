# Isogeo Worker service installation guide

## History

Developed in 2013 by Isogeo, Isogeo Worker was first deployed at the end of that same year and in early 2014. Based on the FME Spatial ETL published by Safe Software, it can be used to read a very large number of geographic data formats, and to extract most of the technical information that you would expect to see in a metadata record.
