# Features

Your GIS data, including all types and formats (Shapefile, MapInfo, ECW, GeoTIFF, Oracle database, PostGIS, etc.), is stored in different locations on your network (drive D:\\;  drive K:\\, database).

To quickly inventorize all this data into a single, comprehensive inventory, Isogeo provides you with the "Isogeo Worker" scan engine.

> The previous "Isogeo Daemon" scan engine will be replaced at the end of 2015.
