# Administration

Access to the administration section is reserved for users with an administrator account.

It includes a number of sections:

* `Isogeo` for configuring workgroups and users;
* `Inventory` for setting up the organization of the inventory in catalogs and shares;
* `Synchronization` for harvesting CSW nodes;
* `Configuration` for configuring available resources at the workgroup level;
* `Applications` for accessing interfaces that are application-independent, such as FME scans.
