## Search engine

The Isogeo search engine works with the following fields:

* Title;
* Name of the file (without its extension) or table;
* Summary;
* Format;
* Keywords;
* INSPIRE themes.

Certain characteristics must be kept in mind when using the search engine:

* It is case-sensitive (lower/upper case);
* It does not accept special characters (punctuation marks, accents, etc.).

## Optimal search principles

Isogeo encourages users to adopt the so-called funnel approach, in line with the logic adopted by the main search systems.

## Search steps

1.	Start to enter the terms in the search bar by choosing from among the auto-completed entries:

2.	Apply the filters: the drop-down menu to the right of the search bar shows the filters available depending on the search results:

3.	Adjust the display using the sort and pagination options:

## Auto-completion

When you key in an entry in the search bar, the auto-complete function proposes the three closest filter values based on the title and identifier.

### Detailed operation

* By browsing the proposed tags from top to bottom, the selected value is displayed (as a replacement) dynamically in the search field;
* By clicking on one of the proposals, the selected value is added to the search;
* By pressing *Enter*, the search is run with the values already added;
* By pressing *Space*, the autocomplete starts over; several tags can thus be added, as necessary.
