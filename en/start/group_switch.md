# My account, my workgroups

In Isogeo, the working unit is the geographic data asset. Each asset has its workgroup.

A workgroup is a set of users (administrators, writers or readers) working on a given asset (such as an inventory).

A user can belong to more than one workgroups, at different levels depending on each group.

# Accessing multiple workgroups

Your Isogeo account can be associated with more than one workgroup. You do not need to log off if you want to change workgroups; proceed as follows:

1.	Click on your name at the top right of the page.
2.	Click on "Change group." A pop-up window displays.
3.	Select the group you wish to change to.
