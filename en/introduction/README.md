# Overview

Isogeo is a software solution for cataloging and sharing GIS data. It can be used to:

* create an exhaustive, up-to-date and documented inventory of the GIS data;
* manage one or more data catalogs based on the inventory;
* share and use the catalog(s) via an extensive array of functions and web services;
* publish your catalogs on a dedicated platform that can be integrated in your websites.

Each body/organization can thus manage its GIS data assets and share them internally with its partners and the general public.

All the functions available in the Isogeo solution are part of a clear, innovative value chain: [inventorizing](/en/introduction/inventorize.html), [documenting](/en/introduction/documentation.html) and [sharing](/en/introduction/share.html) the GIS data in a perfectly straightforward manner.

The diagram below illustrates this value chain:

Before dealing with each function available in the Isogeo solution, it is important to have a clear understanding of this value chain.

Cataloging data and managing metadata represent strategic actions that must not be overlooked in order to **govern and add value to your data assets**. When you undertake to catalog your data, you will often come up against the following questions:

* Which data should I document?
* Which metadata should I enter?
* Which method should I adopt?

To provide you with concrete answers, Isogeo has defined an approved, straightforward value chain. Here are the main steps.
