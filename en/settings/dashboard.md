# Dashboard

![Dashboard](/assets/tdb_formats.png "The Isogeo dashboard")

## A monitoring tool

Representing a home page for administrators, the dashboard shows a summary of your data assets via dynamic graphics and interactive metrics:

* total number of data items inventoried,
* share of data in catalogs and breakdown by catalog,
* breakdown by data type (vector or raster),
* breakdown by format,
* breakdown by projection system,
* breakdown by keyword,
* breakdown by INSPIRE theme,
* total attributes inventoried,
* total geometric objects,
* total contacts.

Each category shown in orange displays a different graphic corresponding to the selected metric:

![Inventory metrics](/assets/tdb_metrics.gif "Shortcuts and menus common to all the platform&apos;s screens")

The elements in the graphics act as filtered shortcuts on the inventory. Thus, for example, in the formats pie chart, if you click on one of the formats shown, you will go directly to the list of corresponding data in that format.

> Note: the metrics only reflect data **that belongs** to your workgroup. Data that other groups have shared with you, or data harvested from a CSW is not represented.

## The workgroup&apos;s point of contact

The contact details shown are those of the workgroup&apos;s global point of contact. It is assigned as the [point of contact for all metadata (fr)](http://georezo.net/wiki/main/donnees/inspire/aide_a_la_saisie_des_metadonnees_inspire#point_de_contact_des_metadonnees); this information is required by the INSPIRE directive, for example.  This point of contact must be distinguished from [contacts associated with datasets and services (fr)](http://georezo.net/wiki/main/donnees/inspire/aide_a_la_saisie_des_metadonnees_inspire#organisations_responsables_de_l_etablissement_de_la_gestion_de_la_maintenance_et_de_la_diffusion_des_series_et_services_de_donnees_geographiques), which must be specified in the corresponding records.

Consequently, it is most important that you enter these contact details by clicking on the edit icon shown when you hold the mouse over the top right part of this area:
