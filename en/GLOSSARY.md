# Platform
A Web platform is a set of cohesive software building blocks used to deliver a service that can be directly accessed via an Internet connection.

# APP
Geographic data administration solution published by Isogeo. Allows geodata managers to organize and enhance their online geographic data catalogs.

# Open Catalog
Geographic data search solution published by Isogeo. Allows geodata users to search, evaluate and use geographic data made available by managers via APP.

# Geodata/geographic data
Geodata is the representation of an object or a real or imaginary phenomenon, in the past, present or future, located in space at a given moment in time, whatever the size and scale of the representation.

# Metadata
Data that defines and/or describes other data. Metadata can be considered the data&apos;s ID card. For example, it specifies when the data was created, by whom, and how. Metadata is essential for cataloging, searching and exchanging data with partners.

Isogeo distinguishes between 5 types of metadata. Metadata related to vector data, raster data, data series, data services and resources. 

# Vector data
Vector data is the geometric representation (point, line, polygon) of an object or a real or imaginary phenomenon, in the past, present or future, located in space at a given moment in time, whatever the size and scale of the representation.

# Raster data
Raster data is a matrix representation (scanned maps, aerial photos, satellite images) of an object or a real or imaginary phenomenon, in the past, present or future, located in space at a given moment in time, whatever the size and scale of the representation.

# Data series
A data series is a group of cohesive data designed and used in accordance with a dominant theme. For example, a local master plan, BD Topo (second component of France&apos;s geographic repository), or a cadastral survey are considered data series. 

# Data service
A networked service or "web service" is a computer program used to communicate and exchange data between heterogeneous applications and systems in distributed environments. It includes a set of features provided on the Internet or on an Intranet by and for applications or machines in real time, without any human intervention. In geomatics, a web service provides a service that allows for remotely integrating data.

There are several types of services covering different functional domains: 
* Search service: CSW (Catalog Service Web)
* Consultation service, i.e., simple map display: WMS (Web Map Service), WFS (Web Feature Service), ESRI Map Service, etc.
* Download service: WFS (Web Feature Service)
* Transformation service: WPS (Web Processing Service)

# Resource
Isogeo was designed for geographic data and services. However, it is perfectly possible to catalog your other "resources", such as PDF maps, spreadsheets, applications, etc.

# Associated resource
An associated resource is a link in the metadata record to the service used to display it (WMS), download it (WFS), transform it (WPS), or to the raw file (shapefile, geojson, etc.), PDF map, business application, etc.

# Workgroup
In Isogeo, the working unit is the geographic data asset. Each asset has its workgroup. A workgroup is a set of users (administrators, writers or readers) working on a given asset (such as an inventory). A user can belong to more than one workgroup, at different levels depending on each group. Workgroups can share catalogs with one another.

# Owner
The owner is linked to the workgroup that created the metadata record on the Isogeo platform.

# Inventory
The inventory is the exhaustive, up-to-date and documented list of data for a workgroup.

# Catalog
The catalog is a set of metadata records. It is used to organize an inventory by publication level (internal data, external data, etc.), by project, by themes, or by status (to be completed, to be verified, to be deleted, duplicates, etc.).

# Scan
A software building block in the Isogeo platform used to quickly inventorize all your data within a unique, exhaustive inventory.

# Entry point
An entry point is the connection between the scan and the data source to be inventorized (database, file server).
