# Documenting

In compliance with the formalism laid down by the INSPIRE directive and the interoperability standards defined by ISO. 3 operations can be distinguished in this documentation phase:

* **Qualify**: describing the data (title, summary, history, geography, general terms and conditions for access and use, contracts, etc.). This operation is facilitated by 3 processes:
    - [automatic retrieval of one third of the required fields](/en/features/documentation/md_fields_autos.html) by the Inspire directive;
    - [batch edition](/en/features/documentation/md_edit_batch.html) (possibility of entering several records at the same time);
    - [import of existing records in XML format](/en/features/documentation/md_import.html).

* **Classify**: assigning sets of themes and keywords using a customizable thesaurus. Essential for cataloging, this step facilitates the subsequent data search.

* **Associate**: associating services with the data (PDF map, interactive map, download link, website, etc.). This operation transforms the metadata into a veritable &apos;resource concentrator&apos; and allows your users to easily access the data.

# Keeping your data assets up to date

Beyond the actual documentation, one of the current difficulties resides in updating the metadata. Isogeo has developed a unique technology to permanently maintain this ongoing link between `data` and `metadata`.

Any changes that have been made to the data are automatically transferred to the corresponding metadata. All operations are identified, then listed in chronological order in the history of the data.
