# Cataloging: a prerequisite for sharing

This step is essential for sharing and adding value to your data assets. It serves to organize the metadata records into different catalogs, for example:

* one catalog for internal use,
* one catalog for partners
* one catalog for the general public.

A given metadata record may belong to a number of catalogs.

With its granular catalog management, Isogeo allows you to manage the publication of your data in line with the target audience.

# Adding value to your data: sharing and publishing your catalogs

The last step in this process consists in adding value to your catalogs with your users. With its controlled permissions management system, Isogeo allows you to publish your data catalogs:

* Internally.
* Externally:
    * to your partners equipped with Isogeo;
    * via your own media (intranet, extranet, internet);
    * within your Geographic Data Infrastructure via a CSW 2.0 standardized web service.

All your users – both internal and external – thus have access to a data catalog and to services for searching, viewing and downloading data.

While Isogeo places metadata at the core of an innovative value chain, producers, users and administrators participate in collectively enhancing and valorizing controlled geographic data in a more global framework in which a territorial method of spatial data governance is defined.
