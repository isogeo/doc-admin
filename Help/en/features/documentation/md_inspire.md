# Creating INSPIRE metadata

Compliance with the INSPIRE directive represents a major challenge for those involved in geographic information. In addition to the French and European expertise brought to you by Isogeo in projects with its clients, the tool helps you comply with the directive's requirements easily and quickly.

A [correspondence table of Isogeo fields with the INSPIRE directive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgqcgCYNe0TfdGI3M1l2WEZaNExxYnpkb29YRzNNY3c&usp=sharing) is available:

[![Single edition - Metadata](/images/annex_Tableau_IsogeoINSPIRE "Single edition - Metadata tab")](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgqcgCYNe0TfdGI3M1l2WEZaNExxYnpkb29YRzNNY3c&usp=sharing)

> Tip: Isogeo automatically infers the ISO category from the INSPIRE theme.

## Validator

The INSPIRE validator adopted by the European Community is integrated in the Isogeo solution.

When data is classified in an Inspire theme (see [the dedicated chapter](/en/features/documentation/md_classify.html#Tagging)), the validator is launched to verify the compliance of your metadata record:
* if it is valid, the message "This dataset description is Inspire compliant." is displayed in the `Identification` tab ;
* if any information is missing, it is listed in yellow.

## INSPIRE in a few clicks

In March 2015, Isogeo presented an online seminar demonstrating how it was possible to comply with INSPIRE in just a few clicks. If your organization is concerned by the directive, see our [blog article](http://blog.isogeo.com/inspire-cartonne-au-webinaire-isogeo) for the webinar where you can view the recording.
