# Completing metadata records

Each resource (data, data series, service, resource) in your inventory is described by its descriptive record (its metadata). A record contains various information shown via a number of tabs; this number depends on the resource being documented.

## Different resource types

There are several possible types of metadata:
* vector-type dataset
* raster-type dataset
* data series (collection)
* service
* resource

## Tabs by metadata type
