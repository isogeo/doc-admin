# Easily classifying my data using tags

In Isogeo you can assign 3 types of tags to the metadata records:

* catalogs, oriented towards uses, businesses, themes;
* INSPIRE themes for data intended to comply with the European directive;
* descriptive keywords.

While you can assign one or more tags of each type to your data, even for INSPIRE, we recommend choosing only one.

## Tagging

This is the first step in the documentation cycle. Tagging is very straightforward in Isogeo; you can assign 3 types of tags:

1.	Go to the inventory and select one or more data items;
2.	Click on `Tag`. The widget starts;

You should now see:
* A list of tags already assigned to the data selected, by type and in alphabetical order;
* An entry field where you can:
    * search tags already assigned;
    * search existing keywords in all Isogeo workgroups (including your own);
* Three filter buttons:
    * `View all catalogs` to display all the catalogs available in your workgroup;
    * `View all Inspire themes` to display all the directive's themes;
    * `View keywords` to display keywords used in the selected data, and keywords that match the search string entered;
