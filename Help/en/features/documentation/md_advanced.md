| Batch edition     | Yes, by overwriting           |

### Encoding

| Definition          | Encoding for the dataset characters           |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Indications         | Encoding defines the way in which characters are encoded. It is often determined by the operating system and software used. For example, if you are creating data using ArcGIS in Windows, the encoding will (very) likely be *Windows-1252* which is a superset of *[ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1)*. |
| Example             | UTF-8 |
| INSPIRE requirement   | Mandatory                   |
| Batch edition     | Yes, by overwriting           |
| Scan                | No                           |
| Search engine | No                         |
