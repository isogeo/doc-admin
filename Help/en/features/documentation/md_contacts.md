| Definition          | Contact details of the organization(s) or person(s) associated with the life of the data (production, management, processing, publishing, etc.) |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Indications         | You must indicate the **contacts associated with the data, not with the metadata or the catalog** ([contact settings are defined in the dashboard](/en/settings/dashboard.html#the-workgroup&apos;s-point-of-contact)). In the list of contacts, choose and assign one of the roles.<br />The administrator can modify the list of available contacts (see [the dedicated chapter](/en/features/admin/contacts.html)).|
| Example             | Team PPIGE > Point of contact<br />IGN > Supplier |
| INSPIRE requirement   | Mandatory                   |
| Batch edition     | Yes, by incrementation           |
| Scan                | No                           |
| Search engine | No                         |


> Tip: you can add the same contact more than once with different roles. However, if you delete this contact, you will delete all its roles.
