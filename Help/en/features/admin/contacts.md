# Managing contacts

All data always has a service or person to contact when necessary. This information must be specified in the metadata record. To make it easier to enter and update, the address book can be used to centralize these contacts.

> Tip: go directly to the [address book](https://app.isogeo.com/admin/address-book).

## Creating or editing a contact

To create a contact, simply proceed as follows:

1.	Select `Administration` > `Address book`;
2.	Click on `+ Add` or on the contact to modify;
3.	Enter or edit the appropriate contact details;
4.	Click on `Create`, `Save` or `Delete`.

All contacts created can be assigned to metadata records using a metadata record's "Contact" tab.

> Tip: none of the contact fields are required to create a contact. This means that you can create all your contacts at once and come back later to complete or modify them, once you have their contact details or have decided on a method or wording.
