# Workgroup parameters

This section is used to customize the workgroup.

> Tip: go directly to [group settings](https://app.isogeo.com/admin/settings).


## Authorizing creation of manual records

If you want to authorize creating manual metadata records, i.e. records that are independent of a data source and not created by the scan.

## Authorize the group to be referenced as a contact

If you want to authorize Isogeo users to specify your user group as a contact on the metadata in their catalogs, simply proceed as follows:

1.	Select `Administration` > `Settings`;
2.	Check the option `Allow group to be added as a contact`.

## Defining the default metadata language

You must specify the metadata language in a metadata record's `Metadata` tab. To specify this information for all new records created, choose the language from those available.

## OpenCatalog theme color

If you want OpenCatalogs to integrate better into your organization's graphic design, you can select the main color of the theme.
