# Configuring specifications

GIS data is often created and verified using a number of technical specifications contained in different document types: official standards, specifications, delivery descriptions, technical roadmaps, etc.

To make your users aware of this important information, Isogeo allows you to manage a centralized specifications repository where you can drill down when entering metadata. Any modifications made to a specification in the repository are dynamically updated in all the records to which a specification applies.

> Tip: go directly to [specifications](https://app.isogeo.com/admin/specifications).

## Specifications types

Isogeo suggests some reference standards by default (INSPIRE, Covadis, etc.). They are easily recognized by the padlock icon next to their name in the list.

Using the tabs, you can filter by:
* [`My specifications`](https://app.isogeo.com/admin/specifications/owned): only specifications for your workgroup;
* [`Others`](https://app.isogeo.com/admin/specifications/shared): specifications suggested by Isogeo by default;
* `All`: all specifications.

## Adding a specification

To add a specification to your workgroup, simply proceed as follows:

1.	Select `Administration` > `Specifications`;
2.	Click on the [`+ New`](https://app.isogeo.com/admin/specifications/new) button;
3.	Enter:
    * Name: a descriptive name generally including the version number or reference date;
    * Link: the URL for the full document of the specification;
    * and a summary of conditions (free or not, paid or not, restricted or not, etc.).
4.	Click on `Create`, `Save` or `Delete`.

All the specifications added are available in the `Quality` > `Specifications` tab.
