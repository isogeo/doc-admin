# Associating data to be downloaded

To provide your catalog users with a better user experience, for example to meet business requirements or as part of an open data approach, you can allow data or documents to be downloaded directly from the metadata record.

You have several options for this:
* hosting the data directly on Isogeo;
* providing a direct link to data hosted elsewhere;
* providing a link to a download service.

## Hosting raw data directly on Isogeo!

You can host raw data or documents on Isogeo using the metadata entry interface.

Proceed as follows:
1. Go to the "Resources" tab and click on `Add a link`.
2. Select "Raw data", then click on the `Upload` tab.
3. Select the file or drag it from your computer.

Isogeo completes the geographic data loop with the dataâ€“metadata link established by the automatic scan and by making raw data available.

Comments:
* Storage is a resource and depends on your agreement. By default, Isogeo offers 100 MB of storage.
* To save bandwidth, you may only upload files smaller than 10 MB.
* For security reasons, scripts and executable files are not permitted.


## Specifying links to data hosted elsewhere

If you use a different online hosting service, you can provide links to your data and documents.
