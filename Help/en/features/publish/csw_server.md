# Publishing your catalog via CSW (harvesting)

Once set up, your data catalog can be "harvested" by any "CSW client", such as national Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) and certain GIS applications (for example, QGIS, GeoNetwork, GeoSource, etc.).

Proceed as follows to enable harvesting for a catalog:

1.	Menu `Administration`  > `Shares`, click `New`;
2.	Click on the gears button;
3.	Select the `CSW` application;
4.	Select the catalog(s) to publish;
5.	Name the share;
6.	`Create`.

The URL of the CSW web service provided by Isogeo comes with a secure key (token). You can renew the service's security key. If you do, remember to inform the recipient(s) of the new URL.
