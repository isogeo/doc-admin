Once you have created your data catalog, you can share it with one or more organizations/bodies that have Isogeo.

This feature is useful if you want to:
* provide your partners with your GIS data catalog;
* reference the data and services offered by your partners in your own catalog;
* co-create and publish a shared data catalog with your partners.

Proceed as follows to share one or more catalogs:

1.	Menu `Administration`  > `Shares`, click `New`;
2.	Select one or more recipients.
3.	Select one or more catalogs to share.
4.	Name the share;
5.	`Create`.

The recipient(s) of your share will be able to view your catalog in their Inventory.

By enabling the option `I allow any of the recipients to reshare these catalogs`, you allow the other organization to publish your catalogs via its own CSW and OpenCatalog shares.
