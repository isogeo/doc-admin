# Objective: enhancing the value of your geographic data assets

Inventorizing, cataloging and documenting are all vectors for good data governance. Once you have taken care of these, you can reap the benefits:
*  internally,
*  with your partners,
*  with the general public (*Open Data*).

## From data to data, via metadata

Metadata are a means, not an end.

To offer your users additional information about your data, or even to allow them to use this additional information, you can associate web services with a metadata record for viewing, downloading, streaming (WMS, WFS, etc.) or even redirecting the user to a PDF map, for example.

The idea is to enhance the user experience, add value to the resources deployed (such as a mapping server), and **transform your catalogs into a special gateway to your data assets**.

## Associating a resource

Proceed as follows:
1.	Open a metadata record.
2.	Click `Edit`.
3.	Go to the `Resources` tab.
4.	Click on `Add a link`.
5.	In the dropdown list, choose the type of link that you wish to associate with the data:
    * raw data (.zip, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) or Isogeo hosting;
    * web services: WMS/Esri Map, WFS/Esri Feature, WMTS/Esri Tile;
    * link: web page, document (Word, PDF, etc.).
6.	Enter:
    * the name of the link
    * the URL of the service or resource
    * Select the resource type:
    * Select the action performed (View, Download, Other)
7.	`Validate`.
