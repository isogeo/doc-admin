## Using online help

Online help is a separate Internet site entirely based on the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) tool. General operation and options available:

* table of contents (can be hidden) that notes pages already viewed;
* search engine;
* click on the right edge to move forward to the next page;
* click on the left edge to move back to the previous page;
* displays on all devices (*responsive design*);
* 3 themes available: white, sepia and black;
* customizable font type and size;
* dynamic glossary;
* each page and each title level has a specific URL, making it easy to share shortcuts (for example: [go directly to the best practices section](/en/support/README.html#best-practices));
* animations can be viewed in a higher resolution by right-clicking and choosing *View image [in a new tab]*;
* buttons for sharing content on social media;
* [PDF document](../Isogeo.Help_en.pdf) generated for printing (not optimized).
