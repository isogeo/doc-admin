## E-mail template to report an error

**To:** [support@isogeo.fr](mailto:support@isogeo.fr?subject=[Scan / OpenCatalog / APP] sujet probleme&cc=projets@isogeo.fr)

**Copy:** project_manager@isogeo.fr

**Subject:** Scan - The number of records returned is not the expected number (number of data items in the entry point)

**Message body**:
Hello,

When entry point *X* is scanned, it returns *Y* metadata records (see attached screenshot), but there are *Z* datasets in the target schema/folder (see attached screenshot).

After checking and upgrading, I am running the latest version of the Isogeo service.

To reproduce this error:

1. Go to the scan interface.
2. Run the scan on entry point *X*: 10 tables are specified.
3. Go to the inventory: only 8 tables are displayed.
