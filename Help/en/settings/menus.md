# The general interface

At the top of the interface, there is a fixed menu and shortcuts bar (the navigation bar) which is **standard on all Isogeo platform screens**. Here are details for the various elements in this bar, from left to right.

## Load icon

A spinning wheel displays between the logo and the search bar when the platform is working or busy, indicating that you must wait.

> Tip: Don't click while the wheel is spinning! If it does not stop turning, reload the page. (Isogeo proverb)

## Search and filters

You can run a simple or advanced search from anywhere in Isogeo and at any time.

## Menus

Isogeo's functions are accessed via 3 menus:

* The [`Inventory`] menu(/en/settings/inventory.html) is used to access your metadata and edit functions
* The [`Dashboard`] menu(/en/settings/dashboard.html) gives administrators an overview of your inventory
* The [`Administration`] menu(/en/settings/administration.html) allows administrators to adjust settings that apply to the entire workgroup

If you are using Isogeo on a low-resolution screen, the tags will be replaced by icons.
